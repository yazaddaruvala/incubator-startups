This is a meant to be an application to help me learn nodejs and supporting packages to build my first web app.

I know at the moment it is really crappy but I am hoping to continually make it better. Hopefully it works out. Basically I want to use the data from this spreadsheet https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AkkhSN3vaY4jdF90b1l1Vnl5NmZjaTBNQWlJYVozMEE&hl=en#gid=7 by Jed Christiansen and make a nice UI for it. Maybe post a summary for each startup from CrunchBase(or similar) if I am allowed. Also implement a crowd-sourced editor to make sure the links are not broken, like a lot of the ones in the spreadsheet, and basically make sure the information is uptodate.
